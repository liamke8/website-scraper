This encompasses preparing beforehand, assigning duties, and complying with legal requirements by conducting  evacuation drills twice per year.\n\n[Book Training](https://firstaidfiresafety.co.za/specialised-training/evacuation-planning/)\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20534'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n![](https://firstaidfiresafety.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/interior-designer-working-with-young-couple-1024x683.jpg)\n\n![Specialised Health and Safety Courses](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20533'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n![Specialised Health and Safety Courses](https://firstaidfiresafety.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/514-1024x682.jpg)\n\nHAZMAT\n------\n\nThe presence of hazardous materials or chemicals is a common occurrence in most work environments and job sites, ranging from low-volume and low-toxicity to large amounts with high toxicity to both human health and the environment. To minimise the consequences of any incidents, employers should have some members of their health and safety team receive specialized training from a health and safety training provider on how to handle these hazardous materials.\n\n[Book Training](https://firstaidfiresafety.co.za/specialised-training/hazardous-material-handling-hazmat/)\n\nStacking and Storage\n--------------------\n\nHaving a well-implemented and maintained system for stacking and storing items is crucial in all work settings. A properly managed and controlled environment allows for efficient inventory management, limits unnecessary expenses, promotes a clean and organised work environment, and decreases the chances of accidents and fires.\n\n[Book Training](https://firstaidfiresafety.co.za/specialised-training/stacking-and-storage/)\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20623'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n![](https://firstaidfiresafety.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/full-shot-man-working-logistic-center-1024x798.jpg)\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20534'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n![](https://firstaidfiresafety.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/burgundy-ribbon-stethoscope-lumber-tabletop-1-1024x683.jpg)\n\nHIV AIDS Awareness\n------------------\n\nHIV, or the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, is a widespread epidemic that has impacted millions globally. The virus undermines the body’s defences, leading to the development of AIDS, which is characterised by a decline in immunity and a strengthening of the virus.\n\n[Book Training](https://firstaidfiresafety.co.za/specialised-training/hiv-aids-awareness/)\n\nFirst Aid, Fire and Evacuation Responder Skills Program\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe three accredited courses that comprise this skills program are a vital component of a company’s legal training requirements for health and safety. The 5-day program provides both hands-on and theoretical instruction in areas such as first aid, firefighting basics, and emergency evacuation planning. To get verification and endorsement, a participant must complete and submit a workplace assignment through the HWSETA site, which can take 4-6 months. Upon completion, only periodic refresher courses are necessary, as the certificate has lifetime validity.\n\n[Book Training](https://firstaidfiresafety.co.za/first-aid-fire-and-evacuation-responder-skills-program/)\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20534'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n![](https://firstaidfiresafety.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/injured-woman-treated-by-paramedic-1024x683.jpg)\n\nFirst Aid, Fire and Safety Training - Specialised Courses\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n##### **Professional**\n\nWe acknowledge the importance of professionalism and the value it brings to our clients and learners, and it is an integral part of our compliance training.  \n\n##### **Quality  \n**\n\nProviding quality specialised training courses through continued professional development, research, and the incorporation of the latest industry trends and knowledge into our courses.\n\n##### **Cost Effective  \n**\n\nWe understand that cost is often a deciding factor and therefore offer cost-effective individual and group compliance pricing structures.\n\nReady to start your training?\n-----------------------------\n\nDownload our course guide to view all course information and pricing.\n\n[Download schedule](https://firstaidfiresafety.co.za/download-course-schedule/)"

This ensures compliance with the Occupational Health and Safety Act 85 of 1993 and its requirements.\n\nFAFST offers various services related to OHS management, such as:\n\n![Safety Inspectors](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n![Safety Inspectors](https://firstaidfiresafety.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/industrial-health-measures-1-1-1024x1024.jpg)\n\nOHS Management Services\n-----------------------\n\nOur specialised OHS management services include a monthly recurring arrangement, where an OHS practitioner is assigned to visit the organisation each month for a day or another specified period. This service is designed to help establish and maintain a customised OHS management system, ensuring that the organisation achieves and upholds a positive status in OHS compliance.\n\n**Price and Duration:**\n\nR8,950.00 (ex VAT) per month (8 hrs)  \n1 day (8 hours) a month\n\nR14,000.00 (ex VAT) per month (16 hrs)  \n2 days (16 hours) a month\n\nR25,000.00 (ex VAT) per month (32 hrs)  \n4 days (32 hours) a month\n\n[Contact Us](https://firstaidfiresafety.co.za/contact/)\n\nOHS Compliance Assessment\n-------------------------\n\nOur OHS experts are equipped to perform an OHS Compliance Assessment that evaluates your existing OHS system. This includes reviewing OHS documentation, risk assessments, organisational structures, training procedures, equipment, and meetings among other elements. Following the assessment, we will deliver a detailed report outlining the organisation’s OHS compliance level as a percentage. This report will highlight areas that are both compliant and non-compliant with the OHS Act and regulations, municipal by-laws, and more. The findings will serve as a basis to strategically enhance the organisation’s OHS standing and compliance score.\n\n**Price:**\n\n**Small:** R5,000.00 (ex VAT)\n\n**Medium:** R7,500.00 (ex VAT)\n\n**Large:** R12,500.00 (ex VAT)\n\n[Contact Us](https://firstaidfiresafety.co.za/contact/)\n\n![Safety Equipment](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n![Safety Equipment](https://firstaidfiresafety.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Safety-equipment-1-1024x1024.jpg)\n\n![Safety Inspectors](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n![Safety Inspectors](https://firstaidfiresafety.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/people-safety-equipment-work-1-1024x1024.jpg)\n\nOHS Equipment Assessment\n------------------------\n\nCompliance with the OHS Act, municipal by-laws, and the SANS national building regulations is mandatory, and it requires that a business’s premises are equipped to meet specific OHS and emergency statutory demands. A FAFST servicing technician or OHS practitioner will come and evaluate your workplace environment. This assessment ensures that the necessary emergency and OHS equipment for compliance and emergency response is present. Note that the OHS equipment assessment solely catalogues the required equipment items and their associated costs, and does not serve as an OHS act compliance assessment.\n\n**Price and Duration:**  \n**Small R 1,500.00 (ex VAT)** min 2 Hrs site assessment plus R 750.00 every hour thereafter  \n  \n**Medium R 3,000.00 (ex VAT)** approx 4 Hrs site assessment plus R 750.00 every hour thereafter  \n  \n**Large R 6,000.00 (ex VAT)** 1 day site assessment plus R 750.00 for every hour thereafter\n\n[Contact Us](https://firstaidfiresafety.co.za/contact/)\n\nOHS Risk Assessment\n-------------------\n\nEffective management of OHS risks stands as a critical objective for any organisation. An OHS practitioner from our team will perform a comprehensive on-site risk assessment at your facilities. This process focuses on identifying and cataloguing each potential hazard, along with its risk level. We will produce a detailed report, both written and photographic, that should be utilised by your management team to formulate a risk management strategy. This strategy should aim to either eliminate or reduce each identified risk. Conducting this OHS risk assessment annually is ideal and plays a vital role in fostering a workplace that is healthy, safe, well-prepared, and compliant.\n\n**Price and Duration:**\n\n**Small size or Low Risk:** \n\n1-day R8,750.00 ex VAT (½ day assessment, ½ day report)\n\n**Medium size or Medium Risk:** \n\n2-days R15,000.00 ex VAT (1 day assessment, 1 day report)\n\n**Large size or High Risk:** \n\n3-days R22,500.00 ex VAT (3 days) + additional cost per day as required R 7,500.00\n\n[Contact Us](https://firstaidfiresafety.co.za/contact/)\n\n![Safety Worker](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n![Safety Worker](https://firstaidfiresafety.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/risk-assessment-2-scaled-1-1536x1025-1-1024x1024.jpg)\n\n![Safety Worker](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n![Safety Worker](https://firstaidfiresafety.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/close-up-doctor-holding-medical-records-1536x1025-1-1-1024x1024.jpg)\n\nOHS Files\n---------\n\nWe offer support to your organisation in developing a current and accurate OHS file. This file will encompass a range of generic OHS documents that feature your company logo. Included within these standard OHS files are documents such as an OHS policy, evacuation policy, OHS organogram, appointment letters, OHS check sheets, and records of committee meetings, including agendas and minutes, among others.\n\n**Price:**  \nR 7,500.00 (ex VAT)\n\n[Contact Us](https://firstaidfiresafety.co.za/contact/)\n\nEvacuation Drills\n-----------------\n\nOrganisations must carry out evacuation drills twice a year to prepare their workforce for the potential occurrence of an emergency or disaster that would need an evacuation.

Following the drill, we will provide a report, both in writing and with photographs, that outlines the strengths, weaknesses, and recommended actions for improving the evacuation procedure and the subsequent drills.\n\nPrice:\n\n**Small company:** 2 x AHS evacuation marshalls @ R7,500.00 (ex VAT)\n\n**Medium company:** 4 x AHS evacuation marshalls @ R12,500.00 (ex VAT)\n\n**Large company:** 6 x AHS evacuation marshalls @ R17,500.00 (ex VAT)\n\nThereafter an additional cost of R2,500.00 per AHS evacuation marshall\n\n[Contact Us](https://firstaidfiresafety.co.za/contact/)\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n![](https://firstaidfiresafety.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Evacuation-Drills-1536x1024-1-1-1024x1024.jpg)\n\nThe OHS Services listed above are an estimate and will be confirmed when our team has discussed your requirements in more detail.\n\nAll prices are exclusive of VAT, travel & accommodation\n\nReady to start your training?\n-----------------------------\n\nDownload our course guide to view all course information and pricing.\n\n[Download schedule](https://firstaidfiresafety.co.za/download-course-schedule/)"

After completion of the servicing of your fire equipment, your company will receive a fire equipment servicing compliance certificate. This Certificate of Compliance (COC) needs to be provided to your local insurance company/broker as proof that your fire equipment was serviced as per SANS 1475 Part 1 & 2.\n\nIn addition to receiving your COC for the firefighting equipment servicing you will also receive a firefighting equipment monthly check sheet, which will assist your fire wardens in completing their monthly check sheets. We will also supply you with an updated firefighting equipment register, which will list all your equipment in terms of: type and size of firefighting equipment, location of the fire equipment, last servicing date and next advisable servicing date.\n\nAs per SANS Part 1 and 2 all stored pressure type (STP) fire extinguishers need to be pressure tested at least once every 5 years and carbon dioxide (CO2) fire extinguishers need to be pressure tested at least once every 10 years. Our firefighting equipment servicing technicians will be able to advise you as to the correct type of servicing that will be required for your various types of fire extinguishers.\n\nThe Right Firefighting Equipment to Have on Site\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThe correct equipment must be available at your workplace and must be regularly maintained and serviced to ensure it is ready to be used in an emergency. These usually include fire extinguishers, hose reels, fire buckets or even fire blankets. Larger office environments may even have sprinkler systems in place. \n\nFire Equipment – Fire Extinguishers, Hose Reels and Fire Hydrants\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRegular maintenance of fire extinguishers is crucial to ensure their readiness for use. When servicing or maintaining fire extinguishers, it’s important to take into account various factors. SANS 1475 mandates an annual maintenance schedule (i.e. every 12 months, not more frequently as some fire servicing companies might suggest) for fire extinguishers, hose reels, and hydrants, and further requires pressure testing of powder, foam, water, and water-based extinguishers every 5 years and CO2 extinguishers every 10 years.\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20544'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n![](https://firstaidfiresafety.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/3d-render-fire-extinguisher-pastel-white-background-1024x696.jpg)\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n![](https://firstaidfiresafety.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/fireblanket1_1024x1024@2x-1024x1024.webp)\n\nFire Blankets\n-------------\n\nFor small fires, particularly in a kitchen, a fire blanket can be utilised. Fire blankets play a crucial role in commercial kitchens, where food is prepared, flammable substances are used, or a significant risk of small fires exists in the workplace, making it a crucial piece of safety gear.\n\nFire Alarms\n-----------\n\nA fire alarm is a vital component of a company’s safety equipment. When properly installed, it reduces the risk of injury or death from fire, smoke, heat, or other factors for employees, visitors, and contractors.\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20534'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n![](https://firstaidfiresafety.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/fire-alarm-switch-1024x683.jpg)\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20534'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n![](https://firstaidfiresafety.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/emergency-evacuation-plan-1024x683.jpg)\n\nEmergency Evacuation Plans\n--------------------------\n\nSANS 23601 outlines the standards for emergency evacuation plans. These plans should be prominently displayed, easily accessible, and readable to anyone present at the site. They must be securely fixed and located in a place where occupants can familiarize themselves with the escape routes.\n\nSite Safety Signs\n-----------------\n\nEffective communication is essential in fostering a culture of safety in the workplace. One way to communicate is by using Site Safety Signs. As stated in General Safety Regulations 3, subsection 6 (OHS Act 85 of 1993), employers must post a highly visible sign at the workplace indicating the location of First Aid kits and the name of the person in charge of them.\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20457'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n![](https://firstaidfiresafety.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7907-1024x585.jpg)\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20520'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n![](https://firstaidfiresafety.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/top-view-safety-construction-helmet-medical-mask-1024x666.jpg)\n\nPersonal Protective Equipment\n-----------------------------\n\nThe role of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is to safeguard employees from workplace hazards and the possibility of injury. PPE should only be used as a last resort, when other methods of protection are insufficient or not feasible.\n\nReady to start your training?\n-----------------------------\n\nDownload our course guide to view all course information and pricing.\n\n[Download schedule](https://firstaidfiresafety.co.za/download-course-schedule/)"
