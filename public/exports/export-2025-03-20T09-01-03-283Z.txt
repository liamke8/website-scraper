Health and Safety Course Prices: Maximizing Value
Source: https://absolutehealth.co.za/blog/health-and-safety-course-prices-how-to-get-the-most-value/

					Health and safety course prices can vary, but understanding the value of the course will help you decide on which company to train your staff. We all know health and safety should never be seen as a grudge purchase; firstly because invaluable safety practice reduces or mitigates risk, which assists in preventing unnecessary harm to employees. In the unfortunate and sometimes unavoidable circumstance where an incident occurs – the health and safety courses and training of staff help to minimise or prevent further damage or injury.
Secondly, a hands-on approach to health and safety communicates to all employees that their company is serious about the wellbeing and safety of all its employees. 
Finally – the legal implications of not being OHS Act compliant have a risk of reputational damage and criminal liability for any company, which is compounded as soon as an unexpected incident occurs, or if the Department of Labour decides to visit or audit your company. 
At the end of the day, a healthy and safe company is a better company, with employees that are happier and more productive. Health and safety implementation and training is a must, so when investigating health and safety course prices, what should you be looking for?
Health and safety course prices: What to Look for in an OHS Supplier
One of the more important aspects to consider when looking at health and safety course prices and training programmes, is their valid accreditation status as well as the quality of service and training experience your supplier has. OHS training is a long term investment as there are ongoing annual health and safety course requirements and training costs, so you should be looking for a long term quality partnership.&nbsp;
Health and safety course prices: OHS Supplier accreditation
First aid training is a very important part of a larger health and safety preparedness emergency care system that is important and critical to a patient or employee’s wellbeing and possible survival. Patients that are injured and waiting for an ambulance to arrive need proper first aiders to assist and keep the patients alive until the emergency services or paramedics arrive. You should never commission a company that does not have proper valid accreditation with the HWSETA and the Department of Labour, to train your staff in first aid and health and safety courses. Your time and money might be wasted and the training might not be valid or recognized as contributing towards Occupational Health and Safety Act compliance. &nbsp;
Health and safety course prices: OHS Supplier experience
The instructors and managers of the company who is responsible for your occupational health and safety act and first aid training should have extensive health and safety knowledge and experience. Their actual operational experience and the fact that they are registered paramedics or professional firefighters will dictate the value and quality of the health and safety, firefighting, and first aid training. 
The more experience that the training team members have, the better the training will be and the better they will be at transferring the critical skills to those attending the training. Staff should also enjoy the training and have a positive experience and inform colleagues that the training was beneficial and worthwhile. An experience first aid training provider will ensure this is achieved!. Having an OHS service provider to train and manage health and safety administration, practice, and processes at your company, has helped many companies achieve compliance and a healthy and safe working environment for everyone. The implications of not being compliant may be severe involving fines and even possible imprisonment!&nbsp;&nbsp;

First Aider's Responsibilities in the Workplace
Source: https://absolutehealth.co.za/blog/first-aider-responsibilities-in-the-workplace/

							
						
						
					
			
						
				
									First aider responsibilities within all workplaces are very important and therefore it is a legal compliance requirement that workplaces have trained first aiders available at all times. First aid is a life-saving skill and therefore first aid response must be available within the work environment to assist with any unexpected emergency. First aid is recognized across the whole world as an important life-saving skill, so it should ideally be available to all people, especially at work. &nbsp; 								
				
				
				
																														
				
				
				
					What is a First Aider and what are their responsibilities in the workplace?				
				
				
				
									The General Safety Regulation from the Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Act 85 of 1993 states:“An employer shall take all reasonable steps that are necessary under the circumstances, to ensure that persons at work receive prompt first aid treatment in case of injury or emergency.”A first aider either volunteers or is appointed by management to attend an accredited first aid course with an accredited first aid training service provider. The most popular course is First Aid Level 1, which is the course that complies with the OHS Act’s requirements. Once the first aider successfully completes the course they should preferably be appointed in writing as the official or appointed company first aider, and be available to perform the following First Aider Responsibilities:Be ready and available during working hours to perform good first aid level 1 responsibilities and duties as and when required;Check that the first aid boxes are correctly stocked and available at all times;Ensure that their first aid certificate is always valid and seek additional training before their existing certificate expires;Report and discuss any first aid requirements and concerns with their supervisor or management; 								
				
				
				
																														
				
				
				
					How to become a certified First Aider				
				
				
				
									Training employees in first aid needs to be completed through an accredited training skills development provider, such as Absolute Health Services. The minimum basic first aid course that is accepted by the Department of Employment and Labour is the 2-day first aid NQF level 1 course. This first aid course is aimed at upskilling employees with the necessary first aid principles, and theoretical and practical skills, to assist patients in emergencies until the emergency services or paramedics arrive. The certificates are only valid for 3 years and need to be renewed before their expiry date as critical skills and new treatment protocols need to be refreshed and taught.

					The types of emergencies that a First Aider might encounter in the workplace				
				
				
				
									First aiders could encounter a broad range of emergencies from a serious full cardiac arrest where a person’s heart has stopped beating, to a minor cut or graze requiring a small plaster. Across this broad range of possible emergencies, first aid plays a critically important role in the “chain of survival” and provides immediate care and first aid assistance until the emergency services and paramedics arrive. Listed below are some examples of emergency conditions and corresponding first aid treatment:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Heart attacks and strokes are common medical emergencies, which may result in sudden cardiac arrest/death. The first aid responsibilities would be to perform good quality CPR to keep the victim alive until the professionals can take over;

Someone is eating lunch in the canteen or at their desk. A piece of food gets lodged in their throat and they start choking and cannot seem to cough it up, so they start turning blue. You as a first aider can assist them by performing first aid abdominal thrusts and back blows until the food is dislodged. If it does not come out, then you will need to call an ambulance, start CPR, and find and use an AED if available;
Slips, trips and falls are the most common workplace accidents and incidents. When these occur they may result in broken bones and severe bleeding. The first aider will be taught how to apply direct pressure to the severe bleed and also how to stabilize and support a broken limb. Direct pressure and stabilization are extremely important first aid responsibilities and skills;

Unconsciousness is a serious emergency caused by many different medical or trauma-related conditions. One of the most important first aid life-saving skills and first aid responsibilities is having the ability to turn an unconscious patient into a recovery position. This position keeps their airway open and protected in order to breathe and not choke on blood or stomach content. &nbsp; 								
				
				
				
																														
				
				
				
					The benefits of having a certified First Aider on staff				
				
				
				
									Within a company’s health and safety team, the first aider plays a vital role in emergency preparedness and availability to perform day-to-day first aid responsibilities when unexpected emergencies and incidents occur. The first aiders, together with the fire wardens and evacuation marshals all form part of a company’s emergency preparedness and evacuation plans. This brave and valuable personnel assist with OHS act compliance and emergency preparedness peace of mind!&nbsp;First aid keeps injured and ill patients alive, so Absolute Health Services thanks all our clients and delegates for attending our courses and for keeping their first aid certificates and skills current and valid.

Getting a Compliance Certificate for Fire Equipment
Source: https://absolutehealth.co.za/blog/how-to-obtain-a-certificate-of-compliance-for-firefighting-equipment/

Ensuring the safety of your property and employees is crucial, and obtaining a Service certificate of compliance for your firefighting equipment is an essential step toward achieving this. A Service certificate verifies that your fire equipment meets the required stringent South African National Standards (SANS) for occupational health and safety. But what exactly is a Service certificate, and how do you obtain one? Here’s a comprehensive guide to help you navigate the process smoothly.

What is the difference between a service certificate and a certificate of compliance?
A service certificate or certificate of service, is a document that confirms your firefighting equipment complies with the South African National Standards (SANS) and Pressure equipment regulations of the Occupational Health &amp; Safety Act (OHS Act). Issuing a certificate of service is a legal requirement and ensures that your equipment is up to date with safety standards. Only the local fire authority can issue a valid CoC or Certificate of Compliance which is a legal document stating that the building is compliant with the National building regulations or the Local fire safety by-laws.
&nbsp;Why is a certificate of service important?
A Certificate of service is essential for several reasons, namely:

Legal requirement: A certificate of service is necessary to comply with health and safety regulations outlined by the Occupational Health and Safety Act and enforced by the Department of Employment &amp; Labour.
Risk mitigation: Helps reduce potential fire hazards by ensuring fire equipment is in optimal condition, thereby protecting your property and employees.
Insurance compliance: Insurance claims might be affected without a valid service certificate, as many insurance companies require a valid service certificate for policy adherence.
Employee safety: Protects your employees and clients by providing a safer working environment.

Certificate of service meaning
A certificate of service serves as proof that your firefighting equipment has been inspected and meets the South African National Standards. This document should be issued by a certified inspector after a thorough inspection.
How long is a Service certificate valid for?
A Certificate of service in South Africa is typically valid for one year. After that, a re-inspection is necessary to ensure continued compliance.
Common types of firefighting equipment requiring a service certificate
To ensure comprehensive compliance, the following firefighting equipment must meet the requirements of the South African National Standards:

Fire Extinguishers: Various types such as water, foam, powder, and CO2.
Fire Hose Reels: Wall-mounted hoses used for extinguishing fires.
Sprinkler Systems: Automated systems for detecting and extinguishing fires.
Fire Hydrants: External and internal hydrants to connect hoses for firefighting.
Smoke Alarms and Fire Detectors: Automated alarms and detectors to identify early fire signs.

Steps to obtain a certificate of service for firefighting equipment

Initial Inspection

· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Contact a certified servicing company: Engage a certified fire equipment servicing company, like Absolute Health Services, to assess your equipment.
· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Evaluate Compliance: The servicing company checks the wear and tear of your fire equipment to verify compliance with safety standards.
· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Report Findings: Receive a report outlining any issues that need correction.
2. Equipment Upgrades or Repairs
· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upgrade Faulty Equipment: Replace or repair equipment that doesn’t meet compliance standards due to wear and tear.
· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Re-Inspection: Schedule a follow-up inspection to verify that all issues have been resolved.
3. Issuance of the Service Certificate
· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Receive Your Certificate of Service: Once your equipment meets the required safety standards, the servicing company issues a Certificate of Service.
· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Keep it Accessible: Ensure that the certificate is stored in an accessible location for verification.

Key points to remember

Occupational Health and Safety Act: Compliance is mandatory under this act.
Approved servicing companies: Only certified companies can issue a valid Certificate of service.
Periodic Inspections: Regular checks are necessary to ensure continued compliance.
Board of South Africa: Ensure your equipment complies with the standards set by the relevant board.
South African National Standards: All equipment must meet the South African National Standards to ensure safety &amp; compliance.

5 Emergency Scene Management Steps
Source: https://absolutehealth.co.za/blog/5-emergency-scene-management-steps-for-first-aiders/

In any emergency, including a medical emergency, the best response is to be prepared with emergency scene management steps. In organisations, management needs to make sure that in case of a medical emergency the first aiders are trained as per the OHS Act under GSR 3(1) and (4), through an accredited training provider which will enable them to confidently manage first aid emergencies at work. Emergency management is the organisation and management of the resources and people responsible for dealing with most humanitarian aspects of emergencies (prevention, preparedness, response, mitigation, and recovery).
In any emergency situation, the first thing you need to do is assess the scene and identify any potential hazards.

1. Remain calm and assess the scene
For first aiders responding to a medical emergency at work, they must remain calm so that they are able to assess the scene, what type of assistance will be required and how many casualties there are, including the priorities if there is more than one casualty. Emergency care is immediate medical care that is available, reserved for severe illnesses or injuries, or any medical need that is life-threatening.

2. Check for hazards and provide a safe environment
Firstly, the safety of the first aider is important, so the responding first aiders must always make sure that they are safe before attempting to assist the casualties. Secondly, the scene or the area where the casualty is situated must also be safe, thirdly the bystanders who might not be aware of dangers that could harm them on the scene, and lastly, we now concentrate on the casualty’s safety. When all aspects of danger have been checked and when it is safe to do so, then the treatment of the casualties according to the seriousness of their injuries can commence.

3. Assess the casualty’s condition and provide first aid as necessary 
Check the responsiveness of the casualty and tap them on the shoulder. If the victim responds and can hear you, then introduce yourself and ask for consent to treat them. If the victim is unresponsive, open their airway to check for any obstructions they might have and at the same time check for skin colour. The tongue is the most common cause of airway obstruction on an unconscious adult patient, so if they are breathing and have no visible neck or back injuries, then they need to be put into the recovery position. To assess breathing, the first aider must look for chest movement, listen for breathing sounds and feel for warm air coming out of the casualty’s airway.

4. Contact emergency services and provide information
When the first aider checks for breathing and responsiveness and there is none, the emergency services must be contacted, and CPR commenced as soon as possible. If a bystander is available, ask them to assist by calling the emergency services and give them as much information as possible regarding the condition of the casualty. It is very important for the bystander to report back to the first aider and confirm that medical assistance is on its way, and what the estimated time of arrival of the emergency medical team is. They can also assist in bringing an AED to the first aider if one is available.

5. Stay with casualty until professional medical help arrives 
The first aider must monitor the casualty until the emergency services arrive. Keep on checking their vital signs every 5 to 10 minutes and record any change that you notice. You must also be prepared to start CPR while you wait for the paramedics. Once they arrive and you hand over the casualty, you must give as much information as possible, explaining how you found the patient, what your treatment was and how the casualty responded to your treatment. If time allows you need to get the casualty’s SAMPLE history (Signs and symptoms, Allergies, Medications, Past medical history, Last meal, Events leading up to injury/illness) so that when you hand them over, you are able to give that information to paramedics or emergency personnel for continued emergency medical care.

Basic vs. Advanced Firefighter Courses
Source: https://absolutehealth.co.za/blog/basic-firefighter-course-versus-advanced-fire-fighter-course/

					It is crucial for companies to have staff do basic firefighter course training and to have the correct equipment available for use, e.g., portable fire extinguishers, fire hose reels, and fire blankets. Early warning systems like smoke and heat detectors as well as sprinkler systems are valuable tools in the fight against fire.
Fire is one of the most destructive forces on earth, not only causing millions of rands of damage each year but also costing lives and devastating injuries.
This poses a question now, to what level must companies train their firefighters? What do you look for in a basic firefighter course requirements? Well, there is no easy answer, but there are a few aspects that will help us to decide.
Absolute Health Services offers two firefighter training courses, a basic firefighter course and an advanced firefighter course. Both firefighting courses have their place in the workplace, and which course would be the correct one will depend on a few things.

What is a basic firefighter course?
The basic firefighter course prepares workplace firefighters to deal with small fires and to detect the fire early enough to safely extinguish it. The basic firefighter course explains to the students what a fire is, how the fire spreads and how to safely find and attack a fire. The course teaches students how to operate various types of fire extinguishers, fire hose reels and fire blankets. The safety of the workplace firefighter is dealt with at length, and should the fire be too big or be spreading quickly, the workplace firefighter will activate the fire alarm, close doors and windows to slow down the fire spread, and evacuate with the rest of the staff. Workplace firefighters having done this course will attempt to fight the fire without any personal protective equipment, and obviously will not be able to fight a big or fast spreading fire.
What is advanced firefighting training?
The advanced firefighting course deals with bigger and fast spreading fires. The training includes the use of personal protective equipment like fire tunics, bunker pants, helmets, flash hoods and fire boots. This course also includes the use of bigger fire hoses that can be connected to a fire hydrant. Bigger hoses mean higher pressures and the students will be trained how to handle these bigger hoses and how to advance these hose lines safely and effectively to the fire. Students will also be trained in how to operate the nozzle (the branch) effectively as this is crucial to effective firefighting. Dangerous and life-threatening situations that develop into big fires like flashovers or back draughts are also dealt with.
What is the difference between basic firefighting courses and advanced firefighting courses?
The basic firefighter course is recommended for smaller companies where the fire load in the building is smaller and there generally is no hazardous materials like flammable liquids, gases or other materials that can cause rapid fire spread or explosions. This course is well suited for most offices and smaller warehouses or even workshops. Fires will normally be discovered quickly in these premises and the smaller fire load and absence of hazardous materials should enable the workplace firefighter to extinguish the fire quickly and safely.
The advanced firefighting course is designed for bigger companies with bigger fire loads and the possibility of hazardous materials being present on the premises. Bigger warehouses, workshops, fuel depots and factories etc. will benefit from this course. These companies often invest in firefighting personal protective equipment for the fire team as well as bigger fire hoses, 38mm, 45mm or 65mm and nozzles (branches), and depending on the company’s fire risk profile, may include self-contained breathing apparatus.

Why is advanced firefighting training important?
The advanced firefighting course will equip the advanced workplace firefighter to deal with bigger and fast spreading fires effectively and safely.
Both firefighting courses deal with the implementation of fire prevention programs in the workplace, recognizing and reporting hazardous situations, safe storage of hazardous materials, implementing good house-keeping rules etc. Both courses also deal with evacuations, evacuation procedures and the roles and responsibilities of the emergency teams in the workplace.&nbsp;
We are of the firm opinion that the best way to extinguish a fire is to prevent it from happening in the first place.
Absolute Health Services makes use of experienced and suitably qualified firefighters to present these courses. Our firefighting course fees are R750.00 for basic and R 1 650.00 for advanced per person.&nbsp;
The students will receive proper hands-on training and instruction on their respective courses (basic or advanced) by a team of highly experienced and energetic firefighters. This will ensure that the workplace firefighter is prepared and able to take on fires in the workplace and feels confident in his ability to do so. Fighting any fire is a high-risk activity and proper training and self-confidence is vital for the workplace firefighter to carry out this function successfully and safely.
The cost of sending employees on fire training pales compares to the cost of a fire destroying a business. History has shown that businesses often don’t recover from such a loss and that means a loss of jobs as well.
A firefighter is only as good as his training is, and an investment in proper training is an investment in your business and in the lives of your employees.&nbsp;

Health and Safety Regulations in South Africa
Source: https://absolutehealth.co.za/blog/health-and-safety-regulations/

There are health and safety regulations and requirements that every organisation, employer, and employee needs to adhere to and comply with, as stated in the Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Act 85 of 1993. Within the OHS Act, there are different sections and different regulations, that together form the OHS Act which is aimed at creating a healthy and safe workplace.&nbsp;

What are Occupational Health and Safety Requirements?
The main OHS requirement is for all organisations to create a health, safe, and prepared working environment for all their employees within the workplace. This includes occupational safety, occupational health, and occupational welfare, which are all interlinked and tied together in the management systems. There may be a safety management system and a production management system, but ideally, when they are implemented they are compatible and can be integrated together, or able to communicate and operate side by side, or together.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Safety legislation and or a safety standard requires all employers and any working environment, big or small to adhere to their compliance requirements. The health and safety regulations, legislation, and standards provide guidance, but the organisation must understand the requirement and then provide the necessary resources and competencies to implement with continuous improvement the safety management system and OHS requirements, which would include:
Conducting health and safety risk assessments and hazard identification;Controlling risks and effective risk management;Establishing structurally sound safety committee’s;Incident investigations and implementing corrective action to prevent recurrence;Training workers in accredited first aid and developing an effective emergency planning plan;Regular monitor and auditing of OHS and compliance to the health and safety regulations;&nbsp;

Health and Safety Regulations
There are different occupational health and safety act regulations, with some regulations related to all industries such as the General Safety Regulation, or some regulations are about specific industries only such as the Construction Regulation. A health and safety regulation lays down how to implement the legal requirements and are quite lengthy in their content as they explain the “in’s and out’s” of the legal requirement. Listed below are some of the health and safety regulations:
General Administrative Regulation;General Safety Regulation;Ergonomics Regulation;Facilities Regulation;Construction Regulation;Hazardous Chemical Substances Regulation;General Machinery Regulation;Electrical Installations Regulation;Asbestos Regulation;Noise-Induced Hearing Loss Regulation;Driven Machinery Regulation;

What are some of the duties required to ensure the health and safety of your employees?
Employers and organisations have an absolute duty to ensure the health, safety, and wellbeing of all their employees and workforce. A way of ensuring that this happens is to have a Health and Safety Manager or Officer with the correct qualification, certification, skills, and experience, employed or contracted to the organisation. This position is at least at a Supervisors level and together with top management financial and leadership and other support, can assist and perform functions such as:
Implement safety systems and safety responsibilities;Identify safety risks and safety issues and implement effective control measures;When conducting workplace inspection, involve the correct worker participants such as the workers in that area being inspected;Continuously or regularly review and monitor the existing health and safety system with a view to improvement;Investigate all incidents to determine their root cause and implement preventative measures to prevent reoccurrence;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many other Health and Safety Regulation compliance requirements.

How are regulations enforced?
Health and safety regulations and laws are enforced by the Department of Labour, which has inspectors in the field visiting workplaces to check if organisations comply with the health and safety regulations. The inspectors check the organisations level of compliance if it is medium, high, or low and depending on that, will either be satisfied or may issue a notice of non-compliance and require the employer to commit to achieving compliance.&nbsp;
If an employer had a poor health management system in place and employees were being exposed and suffering acute and chronic health related illnesses such as noise-induced hearing loss, then the inspector may impose a fine on the organisation. The inspector may even lodge and start a criminal case against the organization. It is best that establish an effective management system that ensures health and safety regulations compliance or even iso 45001 (health and safety) compliance. Currently, the consequence of non-compliance can lead to an R200,000.00 (two hundred thousand) fine, or two years imprisonment, or both!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

9 Basic Steps for First Aid Training
Source: https://absolutehealth.co.za/blog/basic-first-aid-training/

What is basic first aid?
First aid is very similar around the world, as it has developed over hundreds or even thousands of years, since people were ill or injured and required immediate assistance, which is now referred to as “first aid”. The concept or aim of first aid is to provide initial or immediate assistance and assist until professional, or more experienced help arrives and takes over the care.&nbsp;
What makes first aid quite unique is the word “first” – meaning that whoever delivers the aid is often the first person doing so. It is therefore very important that basic care or aid is administered correctly, as it is the first form of assistance an injured person is receiving. 

If the initial first aid is not administered, or administered incorrectly, or not as well as it could or should be administered, then the positive outcome or effect of the first aid care would not be effective and not assist the injured person as much, or as well as it possibly could. An example of this is if someone had a lacerated femoral (upper leg) or brachial (upper arm) artery and was bleeding severely and immediate first aid was required to ensure bleeding stops.&nbsp;
Poor first aid such as not applying enough direct pressure could mean that the person bleeds to death. However, attending a good quality first aid training course would train first aiders in applying good quality direct pressure which would stop the bleeding and the person would probably survive.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As with any course or profession, there is generally a basic or advanced level. Basic first aid would be an entry-level first aid course, where advanced first aid would include the basic content as well as additional topics, information, and more advanced details and skills. A basic first aid training course could be two and a half (2 ½) days and an advanced course could be 5 days in duration.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The principles of basic first aid
The principles of basic first aid include principles, actions, and knowledge that are critical to applying successful first aid treatment in general. These would need to be taught in first aid training courses with the aim of embedding the basic first aid knowledge, into the first aiders’ long term memory.&nbsp;
These principles would include topics and knowledge such as preventing further injury, reducing the risk of infected wounds, preserving life, and promoting recovery. As well as other principles such as safety, contacting the emergency services, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), using an AED (automated external defibrillator), stopping bleeding, lateral recovery position, and other relevant basic first aid knowledge and skills.

These basic principles have been developed over many years to assist in keeping seriously injured or ill patients alive, until the emergency medical services and professional assistance arrive, or the patient arrives at the emergency department or hospital. A basic first aid training course would teach the first aiders to run cold water for 10 to 15 minutes over the burns of a patient who has suffered thermal burns.&nbsp;
This treatment would cool down the burnt area and prevent further burn damage caused by heated up body tissue. Here prevention is applied, one of the principles of first aid. It is therefore important that the principles are adhered to and administered correctly to be effective as part of basic first aid skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Department of Labour recently released a government gazette 44663 on the 4th of June 2021 requiring with immediate effect that all first aid training courses and basic first aid training follow a specific national qualification framework (NQF) route where specific principles and requirements must apply to all first aid training.&nbsp;
All first aid training must be NQF aligned and only first aid accredited training companies such as Absolute Health Services may offer and present first aid training courses. All “old/historic” first aid level 1, 2, and 3 training has ceased to exist and may not be trained any longer used.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The steps to basic first aid training&nbsp;
It is a legislative requirement that all workplaces and employers must be prepared to administer first aid treatment to all employees and colleagues thereof within the workplace. When life-threatening emergencies/ life-threatening condition occur the speed and availability of administering advanced or basic first aid may be the difference between full or partial recovery, or even life or death.&nbsp; The following basic first aid steps can assist in providing valuable assistance to an injured person:
Ensure that the workplace is well prepared with sufficient first aid personnel and first aid equipment such as first aid kits (bandages, gloves, triangular bandages, splints etc);Ensure that it is safe to approach and do not further endanger anyone else;Determine if the patient is breathing, has a pulse and moving and not in full cardiac arrest (not dead);&nbsp;Contact the emergency services, paramedics, or ambulance department to assist with professional medical care;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the patient is unconscious, place them into the lateral recovery position and/or ensure their injured body part is well supported;If they are conscious talk to them and try to keep them calm and obtain necessary information such as their medical history;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop any profuse bleeding by applying all the various bleeding control measures (direct pressure;Conduct a head to toe secondary survey to determine all injuries and treat them accordingly once located;Document all details, information, and times;
The steps listed above are some of the important basic first aid actions which can be followed in sequence and assist in providing valuable life saving first aid care. There are other or different injuries that will require specific treatment to address that specific illness or injury. Attending a first aid training course will enable and empower the first aider with the necessary skills, understanding, and knowledge required.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Tips to carrying out quality basic first aid&nbsp;
Fortunately, first aiders do not need to practise their first aid skills regularly, but unfortunately, that means that these skills are often forgotten. As a first aider it is therefore important to refresh your knowledge and skills regularly, but at least once every year / annually.&nbsp;
Refresher courses can be attended at an accredited first aid training centre or conducted in-house where the first aid instructor conducts the refresher course at your company premises. This is best achieved if the entire first aid team members can get together and as a team practise simulated scenarios together to guide, support, and learn from the team activities and discussions.&nbsp;
Having printed treatment protocols and resuscitation steps available for usage during refresher training and annual evacuation drill practises, can also assist in basic first aid content memory retention.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Importance of SETA Accreditation
Source: https://absolutehealth.co.za/blog/seta-accreditation-and-its-importance/

					The South African Qualifications Authority or SAQA is the controlling authority, which regulates education institutions and the many different skills development providers or training providers around the country. There is a National Qualifications Framework which all training providers need to adhere to and ensure that their training courses are approved and aligned to this framework. 
Below SAQA there are then several different Sectional Education Training Authority’s (SETA) to control the various different business sectors. Depending on the industry involved, will depend on what SETA South Africa the organisation would belong to. Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) training falls within the control of the Health and Welfare SETA (HWSETA). Private and independent training providers such as Absolute Health Services, register as accredited skills development providers with the HWSETA.
The government has established an integrated educational system, with critical institutions and departments of this system being QCTO (Quality Council for Trades and Occupations), SAQA, SETA, skills development providers, and NQF alignment courses, programs, and qualifications. The role of SETA, its accredited training providers, the courses, skills programs, and qualifications they provide, all form part of the building blocks of our country’s educational system.
The Role and Function of SETA
A SETA is the quality assurance body for training and education within a specific business sector, industry, or environment. Listed below are some of the functions of SETA:

 &nbsp;To ensure high-quality training and education standards within their sector;
 &nbsp;To accredit various training providers to enable them to provide training courses, programs, and qualifications to clients and the public;
 &nbsp;To approve individual trainers or instructors as facilitators, assessors, and moderators;
 &nbsp;To verify and endorse completed training courses, programs, and qualifications, in order for them to be uploaded onto the National Learner Database;
 &nbsp;To provide education and training grants and funding to upskill the South African public and community;
 &nbsp;To annually report into SAQA and QCTO on the numbers and stats trained and endorsed within their sector.

Accredited Health and Safety Training Providers
There are many health and safety training providers, but it is critical that clients ensure that their existing or future training provider is accredited by SETA South Africa, such as the HWSETA. Ideally, the training provider needs to be an HWSETA accredited health and safety training provider, such as Absolute Health Services, or at least be accredited with another SETA. The HWSETA quality assures courses, skills programs, and qualifications such as health and safety, home-based care, social workers, auxiliary healthcare, etc.
What is also critical is that the training providers’ health and safety courses and programs are all accredited, as well as the training company having full SETA accreditation. One of the functions of SETA is to accredit health and safety training providers, such as Absolute Health Services to offer different accredited OHS related courses such as:&nbsp;

First aid NQF level 1 – 2 ½ days;
Firefighting – 1 day;
Evacuation planning – 1 day;
H&amp;S representative – 1 day;
H&amp;S supervisor – 2 days;
H&amp;S officer (specialist) – 10 days;
SAQCC 1475 firefighting equipment servicing technician – 5 days;
BLS for healthcare providers;
Various other health and safety-related courses.

It is important to remember that First Aid NQF Level 1 courses and training providers must also be accredited by the Department of Labour, as well as SETA. Customers and clients must understand SETA South Africa and the function and role of SETA to ensure that their training provider of choice is appropriately accredited, as unfortunately many of the training providers don’t meet the SETA and Department of Labour minimum requirements.&nbsp;
A customer or client’s Human Resources, Learning and Development, Procurement or Operations management or department, must understand SETA training provider and accreditation requirements so that the correct checks and questions can be made and asked potential health and safety, training providers. There are many health and safety training providers in South Africa, but unfortunately, many of these providers are inappropriate or unaccredited. Always ask your OHS training provider to show proof of their valid and current SETA South Africa accreditation letter. This accreditation letter must list all the different individual OHS courses, programs, and qualifications, such as First Aid NQF Level 1, Firefighting, Health, and Safety Representative, Health and Safety Officer, etc. Absolute Health Services provides high-quality health and safety training, with state-of-the-art training facilities in Johannesburg North, Durban, Port Elizabeth and Cape Town, but training can also be presented on-site at our client’s premises anywhere in South Africa. Training is also facilitated by professional and experienced paramedics and firefighters, with important practical training aids and equipment such as adult, child, and infant CPR manikins, automated external defibrillators, regulation 7 first aid kits, immobilization and splinting devices, fire fighting extinguishers, and equipment, evacuation chairs, etc. always ensuring that we meet the SETA South Africa skills development training provider requirements.&nbsp;

Overview of Accredited First Aid Training
Source: https://absolutehealth.co.za/blog/accredited-first-aid-training/

					First Aid training in the workplace is not only a legal requirement in South Africa, according to the Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Act 85 of 1993, but is also a life-saving skill that everyone should know in order to assist the injured or ill in an emergency! There are many training providers who are not able to offer accredited first aid training though and fraudulently issue first aid training certificates. Everyone who enrols in first aid training must ensure that their provider is registered and offering accredited first aid training courses. Should you choose to make use of an unaccredited training provider remember that the certificates are illegal and fraudulent as per the National Qualifications Framework (NQF) Amendment Act 12 of 2019.
What is accredited first aid training?&nbsp;
The General Safety Regulation (GSR) Section 3 of the OHS Act states that employers have to make use of accredited&nbsp;first aid training providers. It further states that accredited first aid training providers includes the SA Red Cross Society, St John’s Ambulance, the SA First Aid League, or an organisation approved by the Chief Inspector for this purpose. The Chief Inspector who is employed by the Department of Labour (DOL) will only approve providers to offer accredited first aid training if they have already been given SETA accreditation. If your training provider can only provide either their DOL or their SETA accreditation letter then they are not fully accredited as per the law, both certificates have to be produced.
Many of the SETAs offer accreditation against one or more of the first aid unit standards although the Health and Welfare (HWSETA) is the main SETA for this purpose. The following unit standards are the ones that first aid training providers need to have:
&nbsp;Accredited First Aid Training Provider Standards:

Level
Unit Standard
Description

1
119567
Perform basic life support and first aid procedures

2
120496
Provide risk-based primary emergency care/ first aid in the workplace

3
374680
Provide first aid as an advanced first responder

How to become an accredited first aid trainer?&nbsp;
First Aid instructors are individuals that have registered with one or more Sector Education and Training Authorities (SETAs) against the following unit standards:

&nbsp;First Aid Level 1 –&nbsp;Unit Standard&nbsp; 119567 Perform basic life support and First Aid procedures.&nbsp;
First Aid Level 2 –&nbsp;Unit Standard 120496 Provide risk-based primary emergency care/first aid in the workplace.
First Aid Level 3 –&nbsp;Unit Standard 376480 Provide first aid as an advance first aid responder.

In order to legally teach First Aid, you must be registered with the appropriate standards. Facilitating training without being properly certified could result in fraud charges and your company will lose its accreditation.
Once you are registered with SETA, you’ll need the following:

Certified copy of ID
Certified copies of all relevant certificates
Certified copies of your assessor certificate
Professional body registration
An extended CV

The importance of using an accredited first aid training provider
To be a SETA accredited first aid training provider there is a long list of prerequisites a training provider must meet. Some of these prerequisites include an approved training venue, subject matter experts, accredited facilitators, assessors and moderators, adequate equipment, approved training material etc. It is a long process and there are many non-accredited training providers who don’t bother with this and choose to take the easier route because they will never meet the requirements of the SETA for various reasons.&nbsp;
What do you get when use a provider who is not an accredited first aid training provider?

Substandard training – These providers have not been verified by the SETA or DOL and therefore their level of training can not be guaranteed. The SETA requires a minimum amount of information that has to be included when you are accredited against their unit standards to ensure a certain standard of training is delivered;
Incorrect information – Many unaccredited providers are not subject matter experts and are just regurgitating information they found on the internet. Receiving the correct information is critical and can be the difference between life and death in an emergency.&nbsp;
Incorrect equipment – Unaccredited providers often don’t bother to purchase training equipment like CPR dolls, AEDs, torniques, bandages, etc as it is expensive. An accredited first aid training course should include a lot of practical components as these assist candidates in understanding how to deal with emergencies. When CPR is simply discussed verbally there is no way that it can be applied in real life when it is needed and the money spent on training would have been a waste!

What happens if you choose an un-accredited training provider?
Unaccredited training providers are often a lot cheaper than accredited first aid training providers because they don’t have to carry the costs of facilities, appropriate training staff, or the required equipment. These providers are often selected by companies as it is a save on training expenses. But what is really the implication to the employer for using an unaccredited provider over and above what was listed above?
The GSR 14 states that employers who fail to use accredited first aid training providers, as is requested in GSR 3(4), will be liable to a fine or imprisonment for a period of up to 6 months! Addition to this penalty employers will also be liable to a fine of R200 for each day that the offence continues or an additional imprisonment of one day for each day that the offence continued for a period of up to 90 days. In the long run it is cheaper to use accredited first aid training providers as it is an investment in the health of your staff and it gives you peace of mind of not contravening the law and ending up in prison for it.
